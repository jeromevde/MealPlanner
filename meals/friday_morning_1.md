You can make the pasta yourself. For that you need 100g of flour, 1 egg and some salt. In a bowl, combine the flour with the eggs, kneading until smooth, about 10 minutes. Wrap and rest for 30 minutes. Divide into 4 pieces, roll each into a thin sheet (1-2mm thick) using a rolling pin or pasta machine, and cut into lasagna sheet sizes for your dish. Boil in salted water for 1-2 minutes, then drain. Use in lasagna recipe. Makes 200g pasta dough.
