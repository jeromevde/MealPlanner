# Quinoa and Black Bean Salad

Cook {50g {quinoa, raw}} according to package instructions and let cool. In a bowl, combine the quinoa, {200g {black beans, cooked}}, {25g {red bell pepper, diced}}, {25g {cucumber, diced}}, {10g {red onion, finely chopped}}, {50g {cherry tomatoes, halved}}, and the juice of 1 {{lime}}. Whisk together 3 tablespoons of {21g {olive oil}}, 1 teaspoon of {cumin}, a pinch of {cayenne pepper}, salt, and pepper to taste, then pour over the quinoa mixture and mix well. Add in a generous amount of chopped fresh {cilantro} or {parsley} for freshness. For an extra nutritional boost, you can toss in some diced {avocado} just before serving, but be sure to do this last to prevent browning.  
This salad not only packs a punch in flavor with its mix of spices and fresh ingredients but is also incredibly nutritious,  
offering a good balance of protein, fiber, and healthy fats. It's perfect for meal prep or a quick, healthy lunch.
