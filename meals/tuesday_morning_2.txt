Banana boat

To make a delicious banana boat, start by slicing a piece of sourdough bread about an inch thick. 
In a shallow bowl, whisk together one egg with a splash of milk, a pinch of cinnamon, 
and a dash of vanilla extract to create a flavorful custard. Heat a skillet over medium heat and melt a pat of butter to coat the pan. 
Dip the sourdough slice into the egg mixture, ensuring both sides are well-coated, 
then place it in the hot skillet. Cook for about 2-3 minutes on each side until golden brown and slightly crisp. 
While it’s cooking, thinly slice a ripe banana. Once the bread is done, remove it from the pan, top it with the banana slices, 
and drizzle melted chocolate (or sprinkle chocolate chips) over the top—let the residual heat soften the chocolate slightly. 
Serve warm and enjoy the delightful mix of tangy sourdough, creamy banana, and rich chocolate!
