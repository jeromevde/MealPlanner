# Ham & Cheese Sandwich

For the sourdough, mix 60g of active sourdough starter with 300g of lukewarm water, 375g of Flour, wheat, all-purpose, enriched, unbleached, and 1/2 teaspoons of Salt, table, iodized until no dry spots remain, then ferment overnight for 8-12 hours, shape into a round, and let rise for 1-2 hours before baking in a preheated 230Â°C oven in a Dutch oven for 20 minutes covered, then 25-30 minutes uncovered until golden. But otherwise just buy 2 slices of {150g {sordough bread}}. Once cooled, slice two pieces, lightly toast, and spread with mustard, mayonnaise, or aioli, then layer {30g {Lettuce, leaf, green, raw}}, {60g {Ham, sliced, restaurant}}, and {50g {Cheese, swiss}} (about 2 slices), adding optional {50g sliced {Tomato, roma}}, pickles, or caramelized {50g {Onions, yellow, raw}}. For a warm sandwich, grill in a panini press or skillet with 10g of Butter, stick, unsalted until golden and melty, then serve sliced with a side salad, chips, or soup.
